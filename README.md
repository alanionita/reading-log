| 26/04/2020 | Srinivasa Ramanujan | Wikipedia | [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) | Incredible mathematician, child prodigy, brilliance always finds a way, healthcare for bright people is so crutial, what more could he have done if health was not a problem? |
| 26/04/2020 | Paul Graham | The bus ticket theory of genius | [link](http://paulgraham.com/genius.html) | Have a disinterested obsession with something that matters. It may be that to do great work, you also have to waste a lot of time. When following a "conventionally ambitious path" you decrease the risks, but also decrease the potential reward. Be interested in lots of different things, but don't have too many interests that you can't get deep in any of them. What are the most important problems in your field, and why aren't you working on one of them? If you could take a year off to work on something that probably wouldn't be important but would be really interesting, what would it be? |
